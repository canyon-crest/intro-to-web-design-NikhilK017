            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <img src = "images/Flag_of_India.png" alt = "Flag of India" id="pic1">
            <p id="p1">I was born in India and I am 16 years old. I currently live in San Diego and attend school at CCA. I like taking classes about computer science and engineering, and will most likely major in one of those fields. In my free time, I like to play video games, read, and hang out with my friends. My favorite food is either <span class="highlight">mac and cheese</span> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu" target = "_blank">tiramisu</a>. I am a professional procrastinator.</p>

            

            <h3>My favorite pet</h3>
            <img src = "images/rigbycat.jpg" alt = "A cute cat" id="pic2">
            <p>I don’t have a pet right now, but if I could have one, it would be a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target = "_blank">cat</a>. Cats are just really awesome overall. They’re super easy to take care of, since they don’t need to be walked and stay indoors. They don’t do a whole lot, but they like to just chill with their owners. It’s great to just sit down and relax with a cat.</p>

            

            <h3>My favorite movie</h3>
            <img src = "images/interstellar.jpg" alt = "Interstellar movie poster" id="pic3">
            <p>My favorite movie that I’ve ever seen is <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)" target = "_blank">Interstellar</a>. It’s about a pilot who journeys through space to save humanity. I love the cinematic shots, as a lot of the movie shows very unique visuals and settings. There’s lots of big scientific concepts going on that can be mind-boggling, but once you understand them the movie is very interesting. The movie shows how strong love can be.</p>
